I've been copying and pasting my own scripts around like a chump, and
it's time I grew up. Hello.

I don't expect anyone other than myself to ever care about any of this.
I'm sure you've already got your own weird collection of scripts.

GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)
-------------------------------------

This is a GPLv3 project. If you don't know what it means, it means that
you can copy, distribute, and modify anything and everything here, but
you have to preserve headers and licensing. Pretty standard stuff.

What sets this license apart from others is that, if your project
includes any of my code, then your project must in turn be released
under the GPLv3.

For more information, see COPYING_.

Commit emoji
------------

I've been trying to get into the habit of using emoji in my git commits.
Here's my key:

========= ======================= =================================
Character          Name                          Use
========= ======================= =================================
⚡️        ``:zap:``               Initial commit
✅        ``:white_check_mark:``  Add feature/test
🚧        ``:construction:``      Add failing (skipped) test
🎨        ``:art:``               Refactor tests
💪        ``:muscle:``            Refactor (or "flex") code
📚        ``:books:``             Add data (i.e. without tests)
💚        ``:green_heart:``       Mess with continuous integration
🏠        ``:house:``             Mess with repository structure
📝        ``:memo:``              Write documentation
