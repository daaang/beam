Li'l Configure
==============

A program that generates a ``./configure`` script that generates a
``./config.status`` script that generates a ``Makefile`` along with any
other configurable files.

It'll probably read a yaml file, but I'm nowhere near ready to start
thinking about that part yet.

GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)
-------------------------------------

This is a GPLv3 project. If you don't know what it means, it means that
you can copy, distribute, and modify anything and everything here, but
you have to preserve headers and licensing. Pretty standard stuff.

What sets this license apart from others is that, if your project
includes any of my code, then your project must in turn be released
under the GPLv3.

For more information, see COPYING_.
